# Beholder Thing

This repository is a playground for the Beholder project. The `frontend/` folder now contains a Cloudflare Workers full-stack app that was scaffolded from the official React + Vite tutorial and configured to use TypeScript with SWC.

## Frontend quick start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See `frontend/README.md` for the complete set of commands (build, lint, deploy, etc.).
