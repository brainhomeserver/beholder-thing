## Frontend

- `frontend/` contains a React + Vite SPA configured for Cloudflare Workers with TypeScript + SWC.
- It was scaffolded following the [Cloudflare React guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/).
- Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` from the `frontend` folder to develop locally.
- Use `npm run deploy` to push the Worker to Cloudflare once credentials are configured in your environment.
